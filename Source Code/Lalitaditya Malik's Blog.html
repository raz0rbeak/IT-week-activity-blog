	<h1 align=center>My Journey of Coding</h1>
	<h2 align=left>my first coding language was html, it was taught to me in my previous school when I was in 6th grade, I was introduced QBASIC in 8th class which was quite difficult to understand at first but it eventually got me interested in coding again. The next year when I came to DPS harni in 9th, I also started learning JavaScript for developing games, and recreated many iconic games such as angry birds and the T-rex game seen in google chrome, when one does not have internet connection. Recently, due to this project, I have also started learning html again and used my in-depth knowledge of coding to create this webpage. In the near future, I look forward to learning other coding languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, etc.</h2><br><br>
